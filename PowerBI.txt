*****************

Summuary :- 

SQL is used to insert data 

Collab - online analytical processing

Data Modeling -
Data modeling is the process of diagramming data flows.
 When creating a new or alternate database structure, 
the designer starts with a diagram of how data will flow into and out of 
the database.

Star Scheme -
A star schema is a database organizational structure optimized 
for use in a data warehouse or business intelligence that uses a 
single large fact table to store transactional or measured data, 
and one or more smaller dimensional tables that store attributes 
about the data. 

OLTP online transaction process 

OLTP, or online transactional processing, 
enables the real-time execution of large numbers of database transactions 
by large numbers of people, typically over the internet. 
A database transaction is a change, insertion, deletion, 
or query of data in a database.

As a Database 
now think about amazon 
scales amount , quantiy, shipping address , product 
what OLTP do is store all this in one table
every one is pointing to single database 
and concurrency is higher 


OLAP online analytical process 

Analysis Services. Online analytical processing (OLAP) is a 
technology that organizes large business databases and 
supports complex analysis. It can be used to perform complex analytical
queries without negatively affecting transactional systems.

only organaization is able to view the data 
limited people have the access to view the cart 
here cocurrency is less


---------

we will use Power BI which is a tool 
Tablue is advance

----------

for the reports to be faster we need to use olab database 

report creatation should be used keeping in view the customers 

keep in mind the audience  while creating the reports 

bcoz everyone doesnt need same data 

------------

data lake - OLAP
datalake is a collection of different data sources 

------

star scheme - consits of dimension and fact table  

4 corners Dimension 
and the center point is called the fact table.

A fact table holds the data to be analyzed, 

Dimension table stores data about the ways in which
the data in the fact table can be analyzed

-------

Normalization is the technique of dividing the data into multiple tables
to reduce data redundancy and inconsistency and to achieve data integrity.

Denormalization is the technique of combining the data into a single table
to make data retrieval faster.

It is used to add the redundancy to execute the query quickly.

-------

Data warehouse 

has 2 components 

ETL and reporting 

ETL - extract, transform and load

ETL stands for extract, transform, and load and is a traditionally 
accepted way for organizations to combine data from multiple systems
into a single database, data store, data warehouse, or data lake.

data comes from website to OLTP 
to bring the data in datalake we require using ETL 

As the data is loaded into the data warehouse or data lake, 
the ETL tool sets the stage for long-term analysis and usage of such data.
 Examples include banking data, insurance claims, and retail sales history.


raw data - OLTP -  order confirm - data lake / data warehouse - 

-----------
Deep architecture refers to a long chain of links, leading to inner pages, 

Flat architecture refers to a system where practically no link chains exist
and each page can be reached in one, two or three links.
 
Having a flat website makes it possible to access each page on your 
website quickly.

***************************************************************************

Lets start with POWER BI 

Max time goes in data prep 
---------------

From where do i bring the data 
or 
1> where is the data ? 

-cloud

- on permises 
local database 

typical db supported by power BI 
as power BI is a microsoft hence it will store data on Azure Block storage 

some organaization can use another local database 



----------------

2> how to connect ?

-import data

brings all the data from sql into powerbi 
gets the data from sql server
performs an in memory operation

problems with import data is data retervial is slow 
high amount of data needs to be downloaded from foriegn server 

you cannot have data with 1GB or more 
power BI can handle just 1 GB of data 
For more than 1 GB you need to use tablue 

data gets loaded into the ram 


- direct query 
directly connecting to SQL server 

problem - slow in updating the reports 
data is again and again going back and coming 

laptop is free from memory 



---------------

in tablue we have two options to connect 

- live 
-extract 

-----------------


3> how do you refresh 

gateway - you have created your report 
it is a acess between SQL server and user 

-presonal gateway 
it is my personal gateway and Iam giving access to 4 people 


- on premise data gateway 
if we have created a gateway 
and someone else wants to see it 
then we create a personal gateway 
so that we can share it someelse who wants to see it 

used for sharing info in same orginazation 

anyone accessing the reports need to have a email id 


-----------

OLAP is read only 
no write 
no insert  

-------------

Lets see Data ON Premises 


this is OLTP bcoz we havent combined this 3 datas into single data OLAP

########################

lets us study power BI 

There are 3 componenets in BI 

1.PBI desktop (application for dekstop)
creation is done on desktop 

2.PBI - services (web app)
limited functionality 


3.PBI - Mobile (used on mobile devices )

why is PBI so popular ?

bcoz it is free 

---------------------

diffrence between PBI and other 
- free 
- support uptop only 1 GB 
- doesnt support real time connections

------------------

Experience your data . Any data ,any way , anywhere 

PBI is a cloud based business analytics that enables  

-fast - building a report or accessing the data 
- a live 360 degreee view of your business  - we can create a data lake 
-helps us in data discovery and exploration - EDA 
instead of wriiting a query , open the data in PBI
-insights from any device - use on any device 
-collaboration across any orgn - any one can see it 
-anyone can visualize and analyze data -we can provide excel instead of graph

1000-10,000 limit 

---------------------

Key Benefits and differentiators of Power BI 

- pre built dashboards and reports for popular SaaS solutions 

- real time dashboards update - you can shedule your refresh you want 

Live database are not supported by PBI 

- we can do NLP on PBI 

- INtegrated to microsoft product 

- fast deployment 

-------------------------

report vs visuailition 

Report's is what PBI desktop creates 

gets publish to PBI services
from that only few info is required 
so that selected info is displayed via visualization 


--------------

4 key steps of PBI 

1.prepare -  
2.Explore 
3.Report  - combination of multiple tabs 
one tab for CO , one for Manager , one for freshers 

4.Share 

----------

Sales rep vs sales manager vs sales director 

----------

Knowledge discory is data mining process 

----------

Ques - you have one table sales table , sales date , sales amtn 
skips 2 dates but prints it 
we will do left join with a date coulmn 

-----------

I want to become a smart data scienctics / analytics

---------


POWER BI 

page1 page2 

the writing area in a  page is called canvas 

collection of pages is know as reports 

-------------

3 icons on the left 

- report view  - what we create
 
- data view - what is coming from OLTP / or if we want to do some filtering
/create some new column / sometime we want to add additional field

- model view - tables which cannot be join 

you cannot join two fact tables 
sales and finances 
they dont have primary keys 


question can come what does the views does 

--------------

Cardinality - types of relationship in joins 


one to many 
dimension table is always one 
and 
fact table is many 

--------------

ON the left side we have 3 drag options 

1.Fields 
- gives you all the tables and the columns 
2.VIsualizations 
-shortcuts to create the barplots and pie chart
This is the core tab 
3.Filters 
- we can ask to show us top 10 filter 

diffrn types of filters :- 
 
-report level
-page  level 
-tile level



with a tile - is tables 
without a tile - it is called sheets 



Here we imported a Excel file and skila DB from SQL 
and concolitated into a single report 

After importing files 
NOw lets see data view and model view 



2 methods to link the tables 
drag n drop 
or
create relation ship 

------------------

data cleaning 
get data 
budget 
select budget 

transform data not load data 

it open another tab - power query editor 
(help you in data cleaning operation )
helps you manage and clean your data set 


select budget table 

applied steps  - it records and steps and changes 

remove  3 rows 
use first line as header 
changed type 

grand total - remove column 
delete sub totals rows (catogories - do not contain - total )

select all the months and unpovit 

povit means you are trying to povit your data in a way which is 
directly readable to human 

we have 12 column for 12 months 

Hence we will convert it into rows 

select all 12 column and say unpovit column 
budget 

-------------------


Low level context 


------------

date 
tags = seprate the list out 
lag and longitude - convert into the maps format 


---------------------------

Day2 

Studying Tableau 

-----------------------

Always try to draw on paper what you want to visualize
